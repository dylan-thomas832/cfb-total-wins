# College Football Data 

This was a short project to produce an interesting plot of FBS college football teams total wins versus their total losses (1869-2018).
The graph also plots lines corresponding to overall records of 0.250, 0.500, and 0.750.
I color coordinated the data points by each team's current conference.
These numbers only include wins while they were an FBS program. However they do include wins vacated by the NCAA.

There may be more projects here later if I'm interested.
